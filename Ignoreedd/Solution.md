Something is being ignored

Possibly hidden in comments

Or encoded inside the response

🧾 Step 2 – Analyze Response
-
The response returned:

Y3lyb3N7ZG9udF90cnVzdF9yZWRpcmVjdHN9

The last line looks encoded.

It is clearly:

Base64 encoded string

🔐 Step 3 – Decode the String
-
Encoded value:

Y3lyb3N7ZG9udF90cnVzdF9yZWRpcmVjdHN9

Using CyberChef → From Base64

It decodes to:

cyros{dont_trust_redirects}

🚩 Final Flag
-
cyros{dont_trust_redirects}

🧠 What “Ignoreedd” Means
-
Looking carefully at the HTML response:

There is a redirect meta tag

The encoded flag appears inside an HTML comment

The browser automatically redirects

But the flag is still visible in raw response

This means:

The browser ignored it… but we didn’t.

Hence the name: Ignoreedd
