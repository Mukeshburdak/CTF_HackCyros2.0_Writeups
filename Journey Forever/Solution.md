🧠 Challenge Description
-
The challenge describes:

A late 2017 overnight train journey

Starting from a state capital in eastern India

Ending at one of India’s busiest railway terminals

A nationally recognisable figure

A halt at the station with the least number of alphabets (excluding words like junction, cantonment, station)

We had to:

🔎 Investigation Process
-
1️⃣ Identify the Person

Search queries used:

“2017 famous personality train journey overnight eastern India”

“celebrity travelled by train after decade 2017 news”

This led to news articles about:

👉 Mahendra Singh Dhoni
-
In 2017, he travelled by train from Ranchi (Jharkhand capital) to Delhi.

2️⃣ Identify the Train Route
-
The train had multiple scheduled halts.

We analyzed the list of stations and counted the alphabets in each station name (excluding words like Junction, Cantonment, etc.).

Among all scheduled stops, the station with the least number of letters was:

👉 Muri
-
“MURI” has only 4 letters — the smallest among the halts.

🚩 Final Flag
